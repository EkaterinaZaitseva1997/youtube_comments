topic,comments,interpretation
1,"I think that a lot of people  were talking about their own crushes. They often shared their stories on how they thought that they had a crush, but in hindside were not really attracted to them. They share own experiences.",Shared experiences
2,"Almost all the comments are spam comments or Spanish comments. The comments in Spanish often support the video, and tell the creator to not focus on the hate comment, and tell the haters that they are wrong. I interpreted all the comments just repeating a few words, or religious comments as spam comments.",Support (or Spam)
3,I feel like this topic is less defined. A part of the comments seems to be about relating about the “deeper” feelings. I feel like these comments differ from the comments of topic 1 in the sense that topic 1 was more about sharing relatable specific experiences. The other part of the comments are more negative. I feel like there where a lot of comments of people lecturing her on sexuality/biology/psychology.,Opinions
4,"I think that most of the comments of topic 4 are praising her on the video. Not necessarily because of shared experiences, but more general praise because this could do a lot for the lgbtq+ community or because that coming out is a brave thing to do.",Praise
