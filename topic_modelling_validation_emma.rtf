\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Topic 1: Personal Experiences/Crushes
\f1\b0 \
People talk about their personal experiences of being ace/aro/aro-ace\
\
Common theme: users relate to Jaiden\'92s \'91crush experience\'92 (i.e., picking a crush without actually having one); they share stories from their teenage years that exemplify this behaviour; notably not only aro/ace people relate to the \'91crush experience\'92, other LGBT+ people do, too\
\
Things that recurred in the comments: \
- \'92obsession\'92 over crushes/people, peer pressure\
- forcing oneself to have a crush\
- \'91scoping\'92 for potential crushes\
- feeling that it is a necessity to have a crush (social norm; conditioning)\
- realisation that one is different; some thought they were gay\
- different ideas of what crushes/love/dating are\

\cf0 Overall, this topic is pretty useless.\
- spam (e.g., Christian and Islamic prayers)\

\cf0 - trolling (e.g., about 25 comments repeating \'91not being straight is bad\'92)\
- non-English comments (mostly Spanish)\
\
\

\f0\b Topic 3: Romance & Sexuality
\f1\b0 \
I think \'91romance & sexuality\'92 is a good umbrella term for the comments since they cover quite different aspects of this domain:\
- personal experience/desires with romance/sexuality; being single involuntarily; relationship experiences\
- theorisation of romance/sexuality\
- explanation of asexualty/aromanticism and identities under these broad labels\
- medicalisation of asexuality/aromanticism (thereby, both concepts are often equated with autism)\
- criticism of asexuality (the term itself and the need for labelling)\
- societal pressure to be in a relationship\
\

\f0\b Topic 4: Support\

\f1\b0 Users thank Jaiden for the video\
- appreciation and praise\
- expression of support\
- feeling seen and valid\
- highlight importance of visibility, awareness and representation (and essentially the video)\
\
\

\f0\b General observations:
\f1\b0 \
All top comments are rather long (much longer than the random sample from the sentiment analysis validation). However, this kind of makes sense because longer comments contain more words than might be associated with a topic.\
\
 I think most of the names we identified based on the top 10 keywords fitted the topic pretty well (i.e., Personal Experience, Romance & Sexuality, and Support. Only topic number 2, which we initially labelled \'91Opinion\'92, seems to be unsuitable given that the topic is riddled with spam.\
\
All topics contain some spam comments. For example, topic 1 includes Rickrolls, topic 3 includes a German soldier song, topic 4 includes repeated words and a couple of Chinese comments.\
