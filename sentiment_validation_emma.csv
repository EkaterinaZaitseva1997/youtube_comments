I am sorry people are so judgemental. You helped me figure out and finally come to terms that I'm Ace- like you- I felt pressured to have relationships. 
Hell, I feel pressured to give grandkids to my mom since I'm the only female she brought into this world next to my brothers. None of us really want kids so...I feel this need to give her children before she goes. However you've helped me relax and that I don't need to do anything that makes me uncomfortable and that I can adopt.",Positive

12,text39018,"Amazing vid!

Speaking for myself, I'm a 23 (at the time of writing this) dude, and I call myself bi for simplicity, but I feel I'm a mix of bi and pan at the core of it all, but bi is the label I feel best fits me.

And that thing about how people feel different amounts/percentages of romantic vs intimate attraction, I feel I'm more drawn to the romantic attraction and the more intimate stuff is a bonus, but it does play a role in if I'm romantically interested in someone or not. I just focus more on romance since it's much more wholesome and makes me feel happy.

Again, amazing video Jaiden, glad to see you discover and feel good about yourself! ^^",Positive

Got a libido but no desire to share it with anyone... But being Demi; if I find romantic attraction- I can have fun helping a partner with their libido... Still feels odd even considering having anyone ""help"" me...

My school years were like yours... I got confused trying to find attraction... XD even studied sexual health college books to understand it.

Like I'm friends with this girl who crushes on boys hard and I'm always like ""man why can't I like a guy like that"" and no I don't like girls I'm straight and will not head down that again. I'm both completely fine on my own and I'm an extrovert so I really love hanging out with the people I love.
