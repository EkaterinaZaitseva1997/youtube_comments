1,text48761,"My experience was very similar, I never got ""boy crazy"" like the other girls in my school and I never understood why they would have crushes on certain boys or even celebrities. In elementary school, I just figured I was too young to have those kinds of feelings, but when I got to high school nothing changed. I still wasn't interested in anybody, but I did learn about the ace and aro communities as well as the other labels that fall under those umbrellas while I was a junior. Before I knew about ace/aro I also used to pick a ""crush"" to feel normal and then never think about them again. 
But in all seriousness, watching this video was so reassuring in not just my identity but my experience as well, so thank you. <3",positive

21,text90219,"a little anecdote:

so when i used to believe I was straight (and bi-curious), and I also realized the importance of representation, I made an oc which was asexual and heteroromantic. By trying to make the character's feelings feel organic and true to reality, I learned a TON about the asexual and aromantic community! Because of this, even when I changed the OC's orientation to bisexual (cause I realized I myself am bi), I still felt, and FEEL very close to the aroace community in a sense... It's a bit strange, cause I'm a furiously romantic person, but I genuinely feel I've connected to this community. I get so excited whenever I interact with someone aro/ace, or see aro/ace representation, or just find a little corner of the internet where aro/aces are interacting.

And sometimes, I even feel I can sort of relate to them a lot? I'm like pretty convinced I'm allosexual, but particularly when I hear aces talk about their experiences and preferences, I can fully understand their perspective on relationship and romantic attraction.

Anyway, I'm super excited for you Jaiden <3 I'm glad you're setting boundaries and I'glad you found labels that best suit you",positive

You should differentiate between friendship and partnership, but I think the two aren't as different as they're sometimes made up to be. At least that's how I personally view from the things I've read... I don't personally feel intimate nor romantic attraction either, or at least much of it.

Glad you talked about it because I did kind of know of asexuality, but it wasn't really explained as clearly yet shortly as you put it.
I am personally not the same way in terms of romance or intimatcy, but it's nice to know that others are talking about it, so hopefully, it will become less embarrassing or stressful to talk about in the near future.
