I never have or do I have one, so I just made it up that I liked one random person. I am stressing out about it, and the next day of school is gonna be a total nightmare. My friends actually talked to the crush and mentioned the made-up crush I had to her, and my made-crush is her best friend. I watched this video at least 10000 times just to know that you went through something like this too. (What is ironic is we have the exact same name right down to the spelling, it is stupid how many ways you could spell Jaiden.)"
"2","text4284",1,0.991331186327218,"I'm aroace and I always thought I was a lesbian because I never found men attractive nor handsome even in a sense. I see all men the same. Never found anything exciting about their existence. But with women, I actually get astonished by their beauty. I actually wanted to be bff's with girls so much that I would become a ""pick-me girl"" but for women and women only. To the point that I even trash talked men just so girls would think I'm cool (I know I know) So I wondered to myself, ""Maybe I'm just gay?"" So I lied and said I liked this girl (random girl in class lmao) and we dated for a day (literally one day) and I decided to never speak to her again. That's where it got complicated. And then I was like ""Oh, oop. I'm Aroace."" lmfao"

"4","text14323",1,0.990149978309528,"oh lord well you see im kinda the same way jaiden cause ive never had an actual CRUSH on people. like- kids in my grade would have a crush like earlier this year a bunch of girls were like ‚Äúcmonn u gotta like someone‚Äù so i started obsessing over this one dude. i would never date or kiss him but he was just really cool. in 4th grade i did the same thing to one of my boy bsfs and confused my obsession for a crush. in 6th grade i got a bf but i think it was just me getting really excited to meet him honestly cause he moved to my table, i obsessed over him, and we held hands and stuff but i dont think i actually LIKED him. idk i just really relate to u especially with the obsession part üíÄ"

Like OHHH oh no, wait a minute they actually FEEL all that shit?? Like they feel feel it for real? Well shit I thought we were all just playing an awkward social game that I was bad at and didn't really know why everyone else was having so much fun with it."

My first ""crush was cause the kid got me a giant plushy for my bday and my second was because the dudes name was clay. That was it.

my friends were crushing with this boi in my class, his name is Clay (not their real name, also he uses he/they now). One of my friends asked if I have a crush, and I feel the need to say something. So I just said I liked Clay too. After that day, I basically have to act like I like him too. Soo.. it happened until when I was going to graduate from primary school. My friends were like, ""HEYY CONFESS TO HIM WOOOO"" and I was like, ok sure. Then out of nowhere, Clay surprised me with like flowers and stuff. UNFORTUNATELY, HE LIKES ME and I DON'T. So I just said, 'um yeah sorry, I'm not interested.'
so now me and Clay are besties, and my friends blocked me but idc i love myself ü´Ç"

I faked having a crush on this dude (he was a jerk btw) in elementary school, cos' isn't that what you're supposed to do?? To sum it up I've had all of one genuine crush"

Especially that thing about feeling a need to have a crush, I had already realized that I convinced myself to have a crush on someone because everyone was crushing on someone.
After a little more research I can definitely confirm to be Aromantic and Asexual. So thank you for helping me find out about this.

Though to be honest my Anxiety isn‚Äòt much help because I am genuinely scared that I don‚Äòt love anyone(even my parents) and that if I somehow do fall in love I would become overly possessive."
"10","text18163",1,0.989577419482646,"I remember that I had a couple girlfriends in elementary and middle school but it was more like a friendship than a relationship in my eyes. So around this time I met a boy in my class and fell head over heels. We were friends but I always wanted to be around him and would be annoyed when we couldn't talk or joke. Naturally we drifted apart in highschool, and I realized why I didn't genuinely care for having a relationship with a girl other than being friends and why I was always stuck to him like glue. Sometimes I miss when we'd be able to hangout and just be around each other, and maybe given time I could've told him how I felt about him and if he felt the same, but what can you do?"

With ur age it's kinda naive to say i dont feel lonely. I'm 22 now and i don't feel lonely either, but for example if i look at my parents. They don't have that many friends they spend a lot of time by themselfs. I dont say its gonna be the same for u but it could happen passive, just by ur friends starting to spend more time by themselfs."

When my one friend thought I wanted to date him, I was super embarrassed-- because I didn't. I literally kept fantasizing about like. Having a normal conversation with him and that was it LMAOOO I watched Moulin Rouge like 80 times in a row and was like ""I'm gonna get so good at having a normal conversation with Ewan McGregor."" Still hasn't happened. Maybe one day."

Okay, backstory done, I've been in love twice or at least I think it was love, maybe, first one I didn't do anything about and after graduation I didn't think anything of it, second I confessed that I think I might love them, got rejected, but didn't really care, so thinking back... might actually just have wanted to be really good friends (which I still am with the one I confessed to).

And when it is said to them, ‚ÄúBelieve as the people have believed,‚Äù they say, ‚ÄúShall we believe as the fools have believed?‚Äù In fact, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know. 14.

Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."

This is barely related, but I‚Äôd like to share my own experience with internal and external romantic expectations.

I‚Äôve always been a very sexual+romantic person, but even as late as 26 I still haven‚Äôt had a sexual encounter with anyone nor a serious relationship, despite being reasonably attractive and agreeable. It took me a long time to realize that maybe love/sexual intimacy wouldn‚Äôt happen on the timeframe I wanted it to, and maybe not even at all!

All that is to say is that even as a hetero-cis male occupying (unfortunately) the most privileged cultural echelon, I‚Äôve still had to learn not to let romance/sex and the pursuit of them define me. It really isn‚Äôt everything. And I really appreciate you sharing this, it sounds like you‚Äôve experienced Imposter Syndrome due to external factors on top of the internal pressure I‚Äôm more familiar with. 

I‚Äôll be sure to teach my kids (if I ever have any) to be at ease with themselves regardless of how society teaches them to feel. And I feel better prepared to share those lessons with them in this specific area as a result of your video (though if it comes to that I‚Äôll be sure to give them a researched response). ^-^"
"103","text9296",3,0.998232711261746,"Attraction-To Other People

I‚Äôm a bit of a Geek, so this is how I‚Äôve always understood it.

When it comes to people there are three kinds of Attraction these being;
1)Platonic Attraction
2)Sexual Attraction
And
3)Romantic Attraction.

While these all are distinct and important in their own rights, you can explain them by comparing them to a concept, Learning Theory.

So for the Uninitiated, Learning Theory is a Concept in Psychology, which states three ways in which certain behaviour is encouraged by our brains.

1)Platonic Attraction- Is essentially when you have a want, or a craving to either be someones friend, or be around a friend.

It can be linked to
Operant Conditioning-
Operant Conditioning states that we can associate our Actions with their Consequences.
(An Action that causes a positive Reaction will be repeated.
An Action that causes a negative 
Reaction will typically be avoided more)
So essentially If you have a person who is cool and fun to be around, you want to be around them more because you associate being around them with those feelings.

2)Sexual Attraction- The desire or craving to be sexually intimate with another person.

This Can be linked primarily with 
Classical Conditioning-

Classical Conditioning is basically when 
You have an Involuntary reaction and it has a positive effect on you. This creates an Association with your Involuntary action and the effect, so you will think of the feeling/stimulus when presented with the same/a similar situation.
(In fancy terms, An Involuntary Response that leads to positive stimuli, causes an association in the brain between that Action and the positive stimuli).

This can be seen sexually with the way our brains deal with Sexual attraction,
You connect the involuntary reaction to that person/event to it‚Äôs associated positive feelings(Arousal). This 
(classical conditioning) is often how we create preferences. Like if you take that person to the ‚ÄúBoom Boom Room‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù then you are essentially furfulling the feelings you‚Äôre getting, so it *feels* good.

3)Romantic Attraction-
Now Romantic Attraction seems tricky at first, as it is partially a blend of Operant and Classical Conditioning.

But it is far closely related to 
Social Learning-
Social Learning is the process of making associations by proxy, or vicariously.
Essentially, Romance is a Social construct, So we can make associations between people we see being romantic in media for example, or people we look up to. An Aromantic person would simply not have these associations, (not for any particular reason), and they would struggle to understand Romantic relationships in this way.

‚ÄúThe Spark‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù  has to do with how we expect Love to act: or how we don‚Äôt expect it to. 

When something contradicts an association you have ingrained socially its possible since this new association is more personal that it replaces the old one.

Now we‚Äôve sort of explained what these mean, lets explain their Antitheses. 

Aromantic:
put plainly, Someone who is Aromantic is incapable of/has a very low Capability for, feeling Romantic Attraction.

Asexual: Someone who is Asexual is incapable of/has a very low Capability for feeling Sexual Attraction.

Now, theres a common misconception that ‚ÄúPlatonic Attraction‚Äù means it‚Äôs sexual, this is untrue. 

Platonic means intimate and affectionate, but NOT sexual.

So I offer 
Aplatonic:
Someone who is Aplatonic is incapable of/has a very low capability for feeling Platonic Attraction.


I hope that was helpful!

[Fun Side-Note:
A Sexual or Romantic Attraction for a Particular person(s) is called a ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù.
But a Platonic Attraction for a 
Particular person(s) is called a ‚ÄúSquish‚Äù.]

"104","text12956",3,0.994751718631361,"Just to share something of myself. I'm a straight male, but my ""love life"" has been kinda... non-existent. I rarely develop feelings for a woman, in fact it happened twice in my life (I'm 29) and looking back one of those situations was more of a friendly connection... so I guess I only ever fell in love once. And I still am, because I still meet the woman that I like. And I've told her that I like her, but she doesn't feel the same way, though continues to act far beyond friendly to me (including hugging me out of nowhere, which is something I don't see her do to other people she's just friendly with), which makes it especially difficult for me.

To put it bluntly, I'm very selective what woman I develop feelings for, but no woman ever liked me in that way in the first place. Though strangely, plenty of women have asked me how the hell I'm still single and people have asked me several times if the two ladies were dating me due to the way they were acting around me.

I don't let society dictate for me if it's bad that I'm 29 and still single, I don't give a f*ck, but... it does hurt that the one time I actually liked a woman, it meant nothing to her and that ever since then she keeps acting like I'm a really important friend or something. The part where a woman is not interested, but knows that you are, yet still decides to stick around you like some sort of ultimate best friend is... not a very pleasant experience."
"105","text15915",3,0.993520436936206,"I once tried to get into a relationship with someone who was Aro once and I can say the end result was not a fun experience.

 In a nut shell I'll just say that after knowing her as a family friend for some time I admitted my feelings to her and began spending a lot more time with her personally, The problem came when I made some notion that we were dating and were in a Romantic relationship which is something that she had never shared the idea of. 

She admitted she did feel a little hurt that I spent so much time with her mainly because I had a Romantic interest and not because we were really good friends so after about a month or 2 we had a conversation about her Romantic experiences prior and how they never worked out because she never felt that connection despite going to therapy. In the end we stayed friends but ended up talking less mainly because I was the one to usually call her but after the whole experience I honestly feel guilt anytime I even think about calling. At least I had learned a little on what Aro was at that time."
"106","text16223",3,0.994155146735451,"‚ÄúEmotional detachment is the avoidance of emotional connections. Being emotionally detached, often referred to as having a flat affect, involves the lack of positive or negative feelings or emotions.

It may be a temporary state of being in response to an emotionally traumatic event or the result of a chronic condition, such as depersonalization disorder. The lack of role models who exhibit healthy emotional responses, a history of failed relationships, or fear of being emotionally hurt may also contribute to the development of emotional detachment.

When emotional detachment occurs, it can be difficult to imagine happiness of any kind. Although the person may be clinically depressed, the absence of any emotion may make it difficult to diagnose depression.‚Äù This could be the reason why she has no romantic feelings.

She and I would agree and disagree on many things peacefully. In the end I always uphold that everyone has different experiences and will always disagree. If you assume what you know is right then you‚Äôll never grow and learn. You will reach great heights when you first know nothing. The highest heights are most defined by the deepest depths. Maybe you do end up admiring someone. Maybe you won‚Äôt.. who am I to know what I will or will not do. All I can do is do what I love. 
To me. Attraction is the ability to get and hold attention. Interest is interest. You‚Äôll think more about some than others. What I like about a woman that I get interested in (as a male) is the fact that they have special things that are really important to them that I get the honor to experience with them. I love seeing people gush on something.. it grabs my attention and shows their heart in its fullest. And therefore it‚Äôs attractive. That‚Äôs just my personal experience. My perspective may change tomorrow but today this is my thought

What it all comes down to is do you trust me with your heart? Because I want to take care of it and make you happy and experience life with you(friend or S.O.). This is not exactly to the reader but for sake of perspective.

"108","text20391",3,0.993848252928928,"I definitely feel both romantic and intimate attraction. But to be honest, I've never actually have been in a committed relationship before. There are individuals in my life I have crushes on, and individuals I would like to date. But I do not see myself as an active participant. I don't chase it. If my relationship with one of these people organically develops to a point where we ask one another what type of relationship we want to have...then I would absolutely come out and say that I'm interested. So I don't see myself as a member of either of these categories. 

I do empathize with some of what you're talking about here. I identify as bisexual, and sometimes as pansexual or demisexual. So I usually don't find myself attracted toward straight or gay people, as I am in neither camp. And people who identify as gay or straight usually don't understand where I'm coming from very well. So it is complicated, and a lot of people don't want to understand. It's such an situational thing. I have always found the relationship and compatibility portion of the equation more important and than the sexual or romantic portion. At least at the start. It seems to me the most crucial part of a relationship is the ability to exchange emotion and the ability to work together.

Anyway, that's my two cents."

I hold romantic attraction to my partners but no intimate because I do not like the idea of it involving me. Because of this my partners often think I don't find them attractive in an intimate way. 

Mostly because while I cant find a partner intimately attractive but can a fictional or famous person intimately attractive because I know there's no possible way it can involve me. So I'm somehow able to find fictional situations intimately attractive.  But I don't find them romantically attractive because I do not and can not see myself being with a fictional or famous person romantically because the Romantic part of a relationship is what's important to me. 

It's like how normal people that feel the emotions both for one person. 
I feel both those feels at the same level but only for Romantic feels. 
All while I find Intimate feelings to be like a very mild weird version of Aromantic feelings. 

It feels visually appealing and makes me happy but does nothing for me aside from that.

Unlike strait or gay where they have a reason to be called what they are, asexuality feels as though is has no need for a name. yes i understand Jaiden felt relieved after she found out what she was, but you have to understand that she felt bad after realizing she feels she's  ""different"" from other sexualities, which doesn't fix her problem. she tried grouping herself and only felt distant afterwards. The point is, i feel as though telling yourself that you are unattracted to people is a healthier way to fix your problems rather than finding a way to relate it with someone else. (if you are still confused i'll put it this way, just because someone has symptoms of adhd,  it doesn't always mean that it should be treated medically the exact same way. each body is different and should be dealt with how they feel. asexuality is similar to this, no need to treat it as a group because there is no point and everyone should deal with it their own, healthier way instead of categorizing it to fit in)"

A great example is the idea ""picture it in your head"" I'm personally of the group who doesn't see anything in I ""picture it"" only a vague sense of feeling and my mind using words for me to describe it, but many other people can see an actual image with varying levels of detail. brains handle info differently to each person and while people often have similar thoughts or understandings, no 2 are exactly alike, despite the assumption. like if I say ""I'm tired"" you can picture how you feel when you're tired, but there may be aspects of tiredness that you experience that I don't or vice-versa. 
for a final side note, I personally have an issue with the use of ""Asexual"" when referring to humans, because to me it has a very clearly defined scientific meaning that doesn't apply to humans. Asexual species reproduce without the need of another of the organism, and humans by nature cannot be ""asexual"" as a human cannot get themselves pregnant. I get why it's used as a sexuality, given ""a"" means not when applied to ""sexual"" but really a different term would be better, or at least a different spelling so that the two aren't confused. thought that isn't your concern really.

I‚Äôm asexual, specifically greysexual
***JUST A NOTE 
There are different terms for specific feelings  on the spectrum like greysexual

First I should define greysexual:
Greysexual refers to a feeling of being asexual but not fitting into the main categories, of which there are 2-3.
The main terms being aro-ace and being disgusted by intimate attraction. Some say there is another one (which I can‚Äôt remember) but generally there are 2.
Being greysexual for me looks like this:
I crave romantic attraction, not to get too personal but I like the stereotypical things like cuddling or getting flowers for my partner. With intimate attraction, I can still feel it, but not as much as the average person. With ‚Äúthe deed‚Äù not to get too personal again so I‚Äôll sum it up: 
I don‚Äôt NEED to do it to be happy but as a personal choice, I would like to. 
Being asexual (specifically greysexual) means A LOT of explaining because it‚Äôs such a big spectrum. I completely understand where you‚Äôre coming from jaiden and it was honestly hard for me to say it as well."

I do indeed have an attraction to women (I have EXTREMELY particular credentials on looks) but no woman whom I‚Äôve been attracted to has ever liked me. As a result of this disdain, it leaves me incredibly skeptical about any nice gesture that women does for me until I have established that it was indeed a romantic gesture and we both have the same attraction to each other so I know that I can safely make a move in return if that makes sense. As for having sex, it‚Äôs not so much the sex itself I‚Äôm worried about, it‚Äôs the potential consequences after having sex since I don‚Äôt want to be accused of rape even if I didn‚Äôt rape. Then there‚Äôs the possibility of potentially breaking up and leaving only one parent to raise their children. Also the economic consequences too, having a relationship (at this point in my life) is just WAY too much of a money pit for me. I know this sounds like paranoia but I just haven‚Äôt trusted anyone since middle/high school. I didn‚Äôt have that many true friends."
"115","text28594",3,0.995587366577065,"Thanks so much for sharing this! I know these topics are uncomfortable at times and hard to talk about, but it's important to spread the information. I have accepted that I fall under both spectrums, but it took me a while to truly understand where I fall and why I feel the way I do. I've always injoyed intamacy and being close to people, and it really shows since I show my trust through physical contact. Because of this it's always assumed that I am romantically involved with people I openly show affection to, and since I've grown up in a small school it's easy to find out just who people think I'm dating. It's led to alot of questions from both family and peers, but I've never been bothered nor tried to hide the way I feel, so all I can answer with is that I just don't feel that way and this is how I act with all my friends. I know now through some research that I probably fall under the cupioromantic and cupiosexual bit. Although I'd be happy to be in a relationship with someone and wouldn't mind any form of intamacy, I'm rather happy to just live my life and avoid the romantic drama that I see the people around me go through. 
I hope this helps anyone with similar feelings. Remember that there is no rush to fall in love or get in a relationship, and if you feel the need to fill in the empty space with a willing friend or understanding partner, don't feel bad about it.

"116","text29501",3,0.996111991664052,"I'm def aroaceflux, and lemme tell ya. It was a loooong journey to figuring that out. In fact, I'm almost 30 and I just figured it out like yesterday. (This video legit helped me figure that out). I thought I was just like straight some days, gay on other days, bi on some days, like I was REALLY confused. The MOST confusing part was that I was asexual for the majority of my days. It's a very bizarre feeling to be attracted to one sex/gender one day, and then just not be attracted to anyone anymore the next day. And then another day comes along, and you're attracted to a completely different sex/gender exclusively. But then the day after, you're not attracted to anyone again. It feels like there is no rhyme or reason to your attraction. It made me feel like I was completely broken in my head since I've started being attracted to people, and I just kinda convinced myself ""you're broken, whatever, don't think too much about it"". And honestly, maybe it's true to some degree that I'm broken in the head. But regardless, I've made it this far in life, so I'm not too worried about it. Just makes relationships kinda weird feeling sometimes. But I'm one of those people that gets enjoyment out of making my partner happy no matter what my sexuality or romantic...ality?... is doing that day. So frankly, this is probably the first and last time I'll ever admit to being aroaceflux. For me and my current life, it's much easier to pretend that I'm completely straight and not go into it with people like my friends and my family. Maybe someday I'll admit it to my partner, but I also don't want to throw a wrench in things, so I'm highly doubtful I will... It's just... a lot easier this way. And I'm not unhappy. I'm just not confused anymore. And I don't consider myself necessarily broken anymore. And I'm very happy about that."
"117","text34377",3,0.994510987253914,"Very glad you made this video. Good for you!

The broader Ace label is probably one of the most complicated and involved sexual orientations there is. ""Asexual"" doesn't necessarily have to even mean ""no sexual attraction"". You can be totally turned on by someone but just not want to engage in the actual act of sex. And like Jaiden said, you can have romantic feelings and no sexual ones. Being heteroromantic asexual would mean you want to be with the opposite sex romantically (cuddling, holding hands, kissing, etc), but not actually have sex with anyone.... Which makes things awkward, generally speaking.

And because it's easier--and gives off a less inaccurate image of what you are--to identify as ""straight"" rather than ""asexual"" if you are a heteroromantic asexual, a lot of people just think there's something wrong with you because you're not married and have kids even though you're in your mid 30s.

Don't ask me how I know all this üòÇ. Like I said, this stuff is very complicated and obscure, and I've only really discovered these terms a year ago (obviously I've heard of the term ""asexual"", but always in the common ""unemotional logic monster that doesn't understand why humans would want to form social bonds"" sort of definition)."

Monosexuals only experience attraction to  1 gender and therefore not as powerful. They do have more of an advantage of attracting more individuals because for some reason biphobia exists. At the middle section in the sexuality hierarchy is the bisexuals. They experience attraction to 2 or more genders. Bisexuals, although in the middle of the sexuality hierarchy, experience most of the disadvantages. They have less of a chance to find a partner and they experience discrimination from a portion of monosexuals. On the top of the sexuality hierarchy is the pan/omnisexuals. They experience sexual attraction to ALL genders. That being said, you may ask ‚Äúwhere are the asexuals?‚Äù The asexuals are not in the sexuality hierarchy but in fact SO POWERFUL THAT THEY ARE NOT EVEN IN THE HIERARCHY. They are immortal.

I think something that makes a human a human is our pattern seeking brain. our brain is very unique because it searches for patterns in things which is what we call logic. The way we search for those patterns is by using the knowledge that we have to our advantage. we even made a test to see how good a person can use their knowledge (the IQ test) and as a person with autism I still can pass the iq test very well. although not to brag but I got 146 on the iq test (yes it was real and was made by qualified people) which means I am pretty good at looking for patterns and I pay attention more to them. normal people with 100-110 iq arent stupider than me, they just dont see as much as I do, that doesnt make them a stupid person it just means I am smarter but even that doesnt affect anything, both are human and thats why the human brain is wonderful."

But on the other hand, I feel like romantic relationships are wayy to overrated, and I also feel like platonic relationships are way too underrated as well. You don't need to have romantic relationships to be happy, friends are great too! And honestly, sometimes having friends can be a lot better than a romantic partner.

EDIT: some people took my message the wrong way, so I'm here to clarify. I'm not saying friendships are everything either, and I'm not saying that romantic relationships are pointless. Like I said, I understand. I'm a very romantic person myself actually, so I get that feeling of it being an important thing. However, nowadays people are so pressured to have romantic partners and start having babies that they don't even stop to think whether or not they are ready for a romantic relationship, or if they're ready to take on the responsibility of a family. Some people don't even want to get into a romantic relationship yet, but are so pressured to get into one that they force themselves to find one, and usually that makes the relationship end poorly. It's not the end of the world if you don't have a child, and it's not the end of the world if you don't have a partner yet. I also feel like this mentality of putting romance on such high importance undermines the importance of friendships too. Friendships are just as, if not more important. I mean, where else do you go to find comfort from romance? Your friends and family. Platonic love can be just as loving as romantic love, they're just different ways to do so."

Kinda was hard learning that my heart just doesn't really latch onto people in a romantic or intimate way, it just... doesn't!  I don't feel it in that sense.  
That said, it does make me think that I could have an entirely platonic relationship, and in that sense, when the romance and the intimacy in a found relationship die out, all someone would have is themselves.  
As Ace/Aro, that's all I can start out with, and in that way, I feel that any relationship or friendship I found is started not on fleeting or rampant emotions, but just a deep, solid appreciation and basal understanding of another person.  And in a way, I'm thankful that I don't have the urge to seek out Romantic or Intimate validation with another.  I just like people for what they are, and I hope they see me that way too."
"122","text43592",3,0.995478163632049,"As a someone guilty of perpetuating the ‚Äúeveryone needs romantic love‚Äù culture we live in, I needed to see this. I often feel like I‚Äôm doing my friends a favor when I‚Äôm pushing them to start dating or looking for people they are attracted towards. However, the most satisfied people I‚Äôve ever met have been completely uninterested in relationships or sex. When a housemate of mine told me that he thought he was ace, I told them that he just hadn‚Äôt found the right person yet. He never really confided in me about that sort of stuff afterwards. Looking back on it, I was the first person he told and I probably made him feel like something was wrong with him instead of accepting that he didn‚Äôt need a lover to love his own life. 
More people need to know the difference between aromatic and asexual, and that they are both real. A few years ago another friend of mine was dating someone that came out to them as asexual. She thought that her girlfriend just thought she was unattractive and was just using her for validation. Maybe that was the case, idk, but we‚Äôll never know because my friend came to me and our mutual friends for advise and everyone basically told her that you couldn‚Äôt have romantic attraction without sexual attraction, so she broke up with her girlfriend. I felt like we were doing her a favor but maybe we just pressured our friend into ending their relationship because we didn‚Äôt understand.
All this is to say, I have probably hurt a lot of people or made them feel like there is something wrong with them because no one had ever explained asexual or aromatic to me in a way that I couldn‚Äôt easily rationalize as ‚ÄúOh they just think that because they haven‚Äôt found the right person yet or they are sexually repressed and don‚Äôt know how to acknowledge their sexual attraction‚Äù.

"123","text44551",3,0.997562278282745,"As someone currently in a relationship of over 3 years, what I can say about feeling ""love"" or ""romantic"" or even ""intimate"" with someone is that those feelings happen without a conscious effort. Like, you have the choice to act on those feelings, of course, but not acting on them doesn't make them disappear. It's why a lot of times, people have a hard time accepting themselves as they are, since their conscious is constantly telling them, ""But I've been raised like *this* or *that* and society tells me to *think* this way!"" So, without getting too psychological, whether you feel or don't feel something towards another (on any level), doesn't make you abnormal by any means. You're just being yourself, that's it. As a disclaimer, there's always the possibility of internal changes occurring (again, without a conscious effort), but that's not reflective in who you are *now.*

To give an example from my perspective, in case any are confused by what I mean, I can say from firsthand experience that I am most certainly a romantic and intimate person. I tried being one without the other in my discovery phase (a conscious effort), and it simply felt like something was missing. For me, I view it as, ""How can I express my emotion to my partner without intimacy? How can I be intimate with my partner without any emotion?"" For which I didn't have answers to that made sense to me otherwise. I didn't have to make a conscious effort to know that, rather it was to ensure that was indeed the case, primarily because I had two poor relationships occur one after the other, those being my first two ever. For some like myself, the skepticism may be helpful, but for others, it turns out to be another form of denial. I didn't have to think about *who, specifically* I was attracted to since it only ever occurred with males, not females or anything else (M/F terminology used in regards to sex, to be clear). Others may have to do more thinking in this regard to who they find attractive, romantically and/or intimately.

On another note, don't feel the need to label your internal feelings on this subject. I know a lot of people do, and if it makes them feel better or if it makes it easier to convey to others, great! But not everything needs to fall under a word or two. Even if I fall under being ""straight,"" I'd rather just say, ""Oh, I have a boyfriend."" Or, ""Oh, I like males/men/etc."" Instead, as it feels less awkward than just saying, ""Oh, I'm straight/heterosexual."" To reiterate, you do you, but don't feel pressured to label yourself if you don't feel a need or want to.

In any case, if Jaiden does read this: I think you presented the topic very well, Jaiden, and I completely understand not wanting to be too personal about this sort of thing. Our levels differ, like I could tell how I met my boyfriend and how we got together at any time, for example, but there are still some topics where even a vague mention is stemming on saying too much for me. I'm sure this video will help a lot of people figure themselves out, as well as provide some laughs along the way (it did for me lol). I hope that, too, my comments above will help people out in the comment section in whichever way (which is broadly worded and not specifically directed at you for that reason).

Or, to be more precise, these things seem to be extremely fluid for even the people who insist they are rock solid in their sexuality.

It feels odd to apply any labels or expectations on feelings that are so nuanced that they can be soft or intense, long lasting or fleeting, both or neither for every individual.

I've realized I'm doing an extremely poor job of explaining my own confusion.  I guess the short version is that given how poorly the labels seem to work for people, and how the very concept of reducing human relationships to labels seems futile, I dont really see the purpose of them at all.

I'm also extremely skeptical of any claim to something being impossible on an emotional level.  The difference between ""cant"" and ""dont"" are massive.

...and I'm still doing a terrible job of explaining myself, holy crap.  Like, I'm trying to say that most peoples feelings towards romance and attraction - or lack thereof - are all generally ok and that we, as a society, seem to have such a poor grasp on the biology and psychology  behind it that current definitions are useless."
"125","text52156",3,0.993854479224708,"Hi! I am asexual, and I am glad that you've made this video, Jaiden. Asexuality is a very poorly represented and misunderstood sexual orientation, which has unfortunately lead to quite a lot of discrimination as many misunderstand what is actually means. Of course, people will discriminate even if they do know what it means, but it seems that it's a source of some of it.

I want to add: sexual attraction is NOT the same as libido. Libido can be defined as a general desire for sexual activity for pleasure, whereas sexual attraction, to my understanding (do bear in mind that this, again, is just to my understanding and I haven't personally experienced anything that I have seen explained, do excuse me if it's not 100% accurate), is a form of attraction, those who experience sexual attraction find somebody attraction and wish to have sexual contact with them. Many aces are sex repulsed or sex averse, but not all. Some even enjoy the activities.

Asexuality is by no means a choice or just a preference, I, and many other aces, just don't experience much, if any sexual attraction, unlike an allosexual person. 

HOPEFULLY I explained this well."
"126","text52235",3,0.996913156218641,"I dont rly agree on the ""love is supposed to be based on feelings"" part
yeah.... in theory but not in practice or, rather, that's what people do or follow, except that isn't actual love. The majority of couples that follow ""feelings"" end up splitting up and suddenly find their partner insufferable because these feelings they were following were pure physical brain chemistry, or basically ooga booga monkey horny mode. Love isn't an emotion in itself but it can *create* emotions or generate them within a person. True love is closer to a really close friendship, where it can but doesn't necessarily involve the sex part. True love isn't tied to the ""can I reproduce with this person?"" option... only the primal need to reproduce is tied to that, and that's why you can follow feelings to get to it, as it's pretty much about impulses or (the more developed version) feelings. Feelings and impulses are pretty primitive so, being able to bypass that, you can reach a higher level of abstraction, which is where love can be found at.

But other than that I find everything relatable; I always did the ""I know this person is conventionally attractive, except I don't personally think they're drool-inducing"" thing, in a textbook sort of fashion, which I often had a difficult time explaining to others. I also found myself rationalizing whether or not I like someone ahah but currently I know I could (probably) never find someone attractive enough for me to consider getting intimate with them so I'm content on setting up a ""contract"" deal in the future if it ever comes to that. I also know I love all people purely and, from my experience, I love people more than the average person loves their partner, except I don't personally come to the idea of being intimate with any of them. 

Again, I stand by the perspective that sex, which is tied to reproduction and the life in this physical realm, isn't what defines love, as love is something abstract and hardly defined, to the point some even say it is the core of the universe, the energy that generates all life, makes them strive for positive change, and so on."
"127","text53599",3,0.993745921242388,"Mhhh, thanks for sharing this.
I just want to note, that nobody should feel like needing a romantic relationship to be happy even when not being aromantic.
As Jaiden said, it's kind of wrongfully taught to be such an essential part of life, but I strongly argue that's an issue for everybody regardless of their romantic or sexual orientation. Because even when being able to feel these types of attractions, that doesn't mean you NEED to do anything with it. You can live perfectly fine being single even when being the ""opposite"" of aroace. (To put myself as example: I'd best describe myself as pan but feel happiest as single - and that's not due to bad relationship experiences, bad ""options"" for partners or for a more flexible sex life, but purely and consciously by choice.)
What I'd list as super great advantage about being aroace (though obviously you cannot choose) is that it leaves less room for emotional distractions. Obviously with the trade off of having a hard time understanding others going through that or potentially the fear of missing out on it."
"128","text55598",3,0.997066158750313,"For those still finding yourself, understand this. Nothing is black and white, its all shades of grey. You can be AroAce and still feel some romance, or some sexual desire/attraction. These are blanket terms still. Example: I am Romantic Asexual. But some days I lean more towards Demi-Sexual (only desiring those I am emotionally invested in) because sometimes I just am. Other days, I am entirely A-Sexual. Its all a scale, and results may vary from day to day! :)

As some one who deals with Aro-Aces on the regular, but is only Ace and highly romantic, I always had trouble understanding to a degree how someone could not feel these feelings, simply as it was always touted as 'normal' to be romantic. As I've delt with them and grown closer to them I'm understanding it more. And starting to understand that they do hurt people some times by not understanding that romance is a very real and genuine thing that can be a very sensitive topic. I've seen them fall into the trap of a relationship only to not be able to really reciprocate the emotions of love, or the ideals/practices of romance.

Where they can sometimes come off as cold, or callus. But in fact, they do still have feelings for the person they hurt, just not the 'normalized' ones. They may not make the best romantic partners, but they make the best of companions nonetheless. So long as they do put forth effort to understand their partner's own needs and wants, they can be incrediblygood in relationships should they find themselves stuck in one. A lot of AroAces to get trapped in relationships. Going in before they have words to describe their true feelings. Having kids, being married, or just financially committed with some one before they understand who they really are. And I'm not saying an AroAce cant be happy in that situation. But their partner needs to understand them more. And both need to put in that little bit of extra work to do what is right by each other. 

And I've seen that in time, even some of the most A-romantic people can fall head over heels. Its all a scale, some days the conditions are just right. But who knows, some may never get that feeling. And that's okay too. So long as they can still enjoy life. :)

Jaiden; Thanks for putting this out there and helping others understand their own loved ones better, AND helping those lost Aro-Aces find who they are!"

 What jaiden's feeling, that pressure to qualify your happiness by your intimacy with the opposite sex? There's an entire generation of incels going through it, most of them lonely, depressed men and everyone just assumes, just like with jaiden, that if they're not involved with someone it's always their fault.I agree she should feel however she wants about any consenting adult, end of story; but i adamantly abhor the culture surrounding this topic, because, tbh, i object to its intentions reflected in its methods. It wants all objective authority of a science, and all plausible deniability of a religion, minus any standards for which anyone can hold it to account.
 The fluffy, feel-good video is nice, and i appreciate the honest perspective of someone, like me, who mostly shrugs at dating in general and says 'who has the time?'; but the flag waving is symptomatic of something that isnt nice at all. Any more than those stupid shirts that say ""loveanautistichild"". When i see flags or shirts like that i think 'who made that? Who patented that design? Who's literally benefitting from that thing?'; and the answer is almost always 'no one i'd want to meet.'"

Seems like a huge projection ‚Äúno one can understand me‚Äù when the truth is you can‚Äôt seem to understand other people or yourself so because you can‚Äôt understand either you come up with strange words that don‚Äôt really explain or define things well so you can feel labelled (dunno why you require a label so badly, you‚Äôre just you, but whatever) because you feel left out and confused. I suspect this is because you‚Äôre autistic and many things people do seem strange. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre some new specially named label to make you feel special, you‚Äôre just an autistic person who only talks to themselves or other people with similar issues so no one has explained this to you before.

""To each their own"" I always say, best phrase ever invented btw. I'm just happy for you that you're happy about yourself. Romantic love shouldn't be mandatory nor a requirement for happiness.

It shouldn't be forced upon nor be sought for (idk english sorry if my grammar's wrong). It should always come as natural, organic, or anything that isn't artificially made or it'll feel awkward. It's funny I remember about my different professors in college, they interpret love differently depending on their subject. They said that some look for love for preservation of their kind/genes, some look for love for companionship which was the most common, some look for love for validation, some look for love for curiosity. Sometimes one doesn't know, and that's alright. Some still are confused until later in life, and that's alright. I forgot where I'm going with this but yeah, one's happiness should always come first, within reason.

Also, quick question, is Aromantic Asexual different from non-binary? I'm just so confused with these, I hope that's alright."
"132","text62499",3,0.99475005062996,"I didn't learn the term Demisexual/demiromantic until my early college years. For those who don't know, A demiromantic person is someone who only develops romantic feelings for another person when they have a strong emotional connection to them. This orientation is the gray area on the asexual spectrum.

 For years I let myself be pressured into relationships because I, too, thought that that's what you are suppose to do. I enjoy romantic stories and I'm a hopeless romantic at heart so I figured I just wasn't trying hard enough or that love wasn't as deep as I thought. This left me with a lot of mental and emotional scarring for ""toughing it out through the rough patch"" in very toxic relationships because I thought that was what you had to do. 

Being Demi is lumped into AroAce and is thusly never talked about and can result in people feeling invalid. For years, I thought I was just picky or stingy for not being able to hop straight into a relationship with someone and would beat myself up for it because I do want to be in love! I really do! I just can't find someone who I connect to emotionally and by time I do find someone, we are good friends and confessing would risk our friendship and I never want that. Whenever I try to explain my orientation to someone, I'm never taken seriously and it really sucks.

To anyone in this comment section who is Demisexual/demiromantic! I see you and you are valid! No matter what anyone says!"
"133","text70510",3,0.993957448324983,"Our society centers romantic love so aggressively and I don't think that obsession is good for just about anyone. There is so much more to life than romantic love and sex. I wish we did a better job of celebrating platonic love and self-love as much as romantic love. And I really, really wish we did a better job of teaching kids that there are whole spectrums of feelings and interests they might have in relation to others and that there is no one formula for what is ""right"" or ""normal."" BTW, I think this info is important for all people, not just those who are aro/ace.

Like, the idea we seem to have that it's sad and lonely to NOT be in a romantic relationship or to not be having sex with others is...super unhealthy. I think that, frequently, people are in a place where they need to not have a romantic relationship to be tending so they can tend to themselves. I also think it's really bad idea to be in a relationship with the wrong person just because you feel like it's better to be in a romantic relationship. You can have a happy and fulfilling life without a partner, even if you aren't aro.

"134","text74370",3,0.995890965110807,"A lot of your experience lines up with my own. I spent a big chunk of my teens dealing with a lot trauma because of school. To sum up a long rant, separating out the kids who are exceptionally quicker or slower at learning tend to impede their emotional development. I did a lot of repression through the end of high school, so I spent the last 15 years learning how to open up and deal with my emotions in a healthy and direct way. It involves a lot of talking to yourself and introspection that feels weird sometimes but ends up being very helpful.

On the sexuality front, I'm in a weird place. I'm a bog standard hetero male, far as I can tell. Thing is, due to a lot of the above, I haven't dated much (some of that is on me, admittedly) and had almost no romantic relationships. The couple I did got really toxic really fast so I got the hell out. At this point in my life, my romantic feelings are for a woman I know who loves me very much as her friend but doesn't want a romantic relationship due to a lack of attraction to me. We have been very up front with each other about how we feel, and while there have been a couple bumps we've made it work. On the one hand, I recognize this is very strange. On the other, it has really helped me sort out my feelings without a lot of distractions. She has been nothing short of an angel to me, and I love her to the bottom of my heart. I've thought about dating, but I feel hesitant to do that given I like my life and the place I'm in. I know I'd need a very special person to really make that work, and I wonder if I haven't done that already. Strange, for sure, but I'm happy with my life."
"135","text77059",3,0.997135934981854,"Here's some other stuff about asexuality and aromanticism for anyone here to learn (don't click read more if you don't want to read- this is a long message);

>Aspec is an umbrella term for asexuality and aromanticism.

>Squishes are like a platonic crush- they're non-romantic, non-intimate (Should I replace the funky-word with intimate and stuff like Jaiden did? Eh, sure), but you still get those butterflies of excitement when you're with that person!

>Amatonormativity is the idea that everybody feels romantic attraction/wants a romantic partner, and/or marriage is a goal for everyone. It's pretty much Arophobia- but it's moreso how society is. Kinda what Jaiden described with how we're taught that love and romance are essential and stuff. Obviously, this is not true!  

>People who do feel sexual attraction are called allosexuals, people who feel romantic attraction are called alloromantics. Allo includes everything not aspec (gay, bi, pan).

>What Jaiden described at around 8:58 sounds a lot like the Split Attraction Model. It's essentially a way of denoting the difference between your romantic and intimate attractions. For example you may be Biromantic Asexual, or Panromantic Homosexual 

>There exists Tertiary attractions. Some aroaces may experience attraction to people under a few other kinds of attraction. For example platonic, aesthetic, sensual (like non-intimate touch), emotional/alterous (not really romantic or platonic- sorta somewhere inbetween). Tertiary attractions can be towards any gender (hetero, homo, bi, pan).

>QPR's! Queer-Platonic Relationships. They're relationships that are more intimate than platonic relationships, but not as intimate as a romantic relationship. You may do things like hand-holding, cuddling, the consensual thing- but it's not a romantic relationship. That doesn't mean it's not as important as a romantic relationship though.

>There are many microlabels- I won't give detail but you can look them up if you want. All of these exist for both romantic and the sexual orientations; Demi-, Gray-, Aego-, Cupio-, Apothi-, Lithro-, Quoi-, and -Flux. The big ones here are Demi and Gray.

>Asexuals can do the hoinky-spoinky, and Aromantics can have romantic relationships. Of course, many won't, but you shouldn't shun aros/aces who do.

Thanks for reading, asexuality and aromanticism totally need to be more understood."

I‚Äôm cis and straight, so I may be a bit out of touch, but I‚Äôm honestly sick of people making videos that are basically just them saying,‚Äùhey, I‚Äôm gay/trans/<insert other label here>‚Äù. My response is always,‚Äùok, and?‚Äú I get that people see ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù as a big deal because of how much societal pressure there is to be straight, cis, etc. But focusing on ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù, rather than just living your life and having people find out naturally, is completely counterproductive. If we really want to normalize talking about these topics, why do we feel that LGBTQ people should have to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù? And that doesn‚Äôt just apply to sexuality/gender. For example, I have autism, and I don‚Äôt ever feel the need to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù with the fact that I have autism. If it comes up in conversation, then I have no issue telling people that. But I don‚Äôt use my autism as a disclaimer, or as something that there needs to be ‚Äúa talk‚Äù about. By not emphasizing someone‚Äôs ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù, it normalizes casual conversations about these topics.

I may not have experienced the scary process of realizing you‚Äôre LGBTQ, but I do know that it‚Äôs very difficult for a lot of people, and I think a lot of that has to do with the amount of emphasis people put on the realization itself, rather than just simply living your life while learning more about yourself. I hope anyone reading this thinks a bit about what I‚Äôve said. If anyone disagrees with me or has any other thoughts, I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys have to say!

There's a lot to 'romance', in terms of psychology, biology and societal aspects; yet society often paints it as a very blunt thing, that it's necessary for one reason or another. A lot of those reasons end up being factitious, as other means exist to achieve what some of them often are; don't wanna grow old and die alone? start a family, but you can also create a family with strong bonds to people in a non sexual or physically intimate way. Not everyone feels a strong emotional need or physical need either, but can still feel desire to reproduce either instinctually or for other reasons. Deep, emotional love is also often that rarely genuinely happens for many people, often times it ends up being one sided or shallow. There's also all kinds of romantic relationships; friendship, familial bonds, platonic, it's quite a diverse range of things and is why we find such difficulty in concretely defining what 'Love' is. Not mention all the literal chemical stuff going on with you whenever certain considerations are met."

I always felt romantic and sexual attraction, but never to multiple people at the same time. I never understood how a person could cheat or even do one night stands as I felt there needed to be some connection first. Once I was in a relationship I literally experienced no crushes or sexual feelings towards until after it ended. My eyes were for her, and her only. 

It took me using a dating app and seeing the amount of descriptions to learn that I am Demi-romantic and Demi-sexual. I had a slightly similar realization that you described as it made me better understand how I felt. I *need* to be close friends with someone before I feel a desire to date them. And I *need* romantic feelings before any bedroom fun happens.

I don't really bring it up to anyone because I am 'straight' and don't want to feel like I am being disrespectful to the LGBT+ Community, because I do not face the same discrimination that they do. But to know that some people feel the same way as I do, and some don't helps me better understand myself and the world we live in.

All those logical methods/conclusions you made about relationships are exactly what I did in school. I felt I HAD to be in a relationship because it was common / ""normal"" to do.

I only learned about being ace when I talked with a friend who already knew about the concept. They sent me to a website and while I read down the list of things an ace person feels/ goes through, it clicked for me. It made so much sense and, for the first time, I felt I could finally pin down what I was.

I also get that isolating part. In one of my friend groups, having to explain to people that I don't... feel intimate attraction to anyone is rather exhausting. Especially when they go: ""But... how can someone not want to be intimate like that?"" (Paraphrasing with a euphemism for the actual word itself). I've even encountered people who thought being ace was impossible. They always went ""Oh, you just haven't found the right person!""

I don't wanna be isolated/lonely. I still want to have friends and family, and I still love them greatly... but I don't have ""intimate"" feelings for people.

You seem to think that just because you feel that way makes your stance valid, but there's a lot more to sexuality than just what you think you feel. Feelings don't come out of thin air. Most feelings are related your past experiences. I don't believe you are actually aroace not because what you said in your video was wrong, but because you didn't explain why you don't have any romantic/intimacy feelings towards your friends. You just say that you don't have these feelings and leave it at that with no deep thought behind it. I honestly think it's harmful to tell people that if you have atypical feelings towards intimacy or even just think you have some form or neurodivergency, then you should accept that's the case without consulting any psychological professional. I know that they cannot determine your actual sezuality, but they can help you find out if your description of your feelings are valid or not. You might not care about being in a relationship right now, but I don't think you should perpetuate the idea that it's ok to think that you'll never have an intimate relationship if you just feel like you can't. Like you said in your video, a lot of aroace people struggle a lot to deal with it and saying ""well it didn't bother me,"" can be dismissive of their experiences.

As an adult I've definitively realized that ""adult fun time"" actives are not something I enjoyed, or even wanted to take part in. The problem is that I've always felt this way, but because of societal expectations and ""norms"" around being a teenager, I always felt like something was wrong with me, and many people tried to ""fix"" me. Finally having a term that explains and encapsulates what I feel, or maybe more accurately, what I don't feel has been very liberating, and has quelled many of the negative thought I've had about myself because I was ""broken."" Now realizing that there was never anything wrong with me, I can recognize how twisted my perception of love was. Looking back at all the things I did in relationships, that I thought I have to do because we were ""in love"", I feel.... I guess broken, it's hard to explain. I've thought about it so often because I wasn't given a choice, either you do what you are told or they no longer love you, and I was told that it gets better with time, or you just haven't met the right one. I am happy to say that I have met the right one finally, my current boyfriend always gives me a choice, no guilt, no strings attached, just really love, and I don't think he'll ever understand how much that means to me. But this is exactly why gender identity and sexual orientation is such a vitally important topic that young teens should be learning about.

Turns out I was just confusing types of attraction :') anyway here's a lot of information, starting with kinds of attraction

-romantic (obviously)
-'intimate' (obviously)
-platonic: you wanna be friends with them
-sensual: you wanna touch them in non-intimate ways (cuddling, holding hands, that stuff)
-aesthetic: you appreciate how they look
-alterous: not platonic and not romantic, somewhere in between
-exteramo: not platonic, romantic or anywhere in between (i dont really understand this one tbh)
-queerplatonic: attraction that bends rules for telling apart romantic and non-romantic attraction (don't really get this one either)

And some other terms:
-oriented aroace: someone who's aroace and feels another kind of attraction significant enough to mention alongside it
-angled aroace: pretty much the same as oriented, but for aro-spec and ace-spec people. for example if you're demiromantic and grey ace

Some aro-spec orientations:
-demiromantic: you only feel romantic attraction after developing a deep bond with that person
-greyromantic: you relate to aromanticism but feel romantic attraction very infrequently
-aegoromantic: you like the idea of romance but don't want or feel it for yourself
-frayromantic: you only feel romantic attraction to people you don't know well, once you get to know them the attraction fades
-cupioromantic: you want to be in a romantic relationship but you don't feel romantic attraction
-lithromantic: feeling romantic attraction but not wanting it reciprocated
-recipromantic: only developing romantic feelings unless you know the other person is attracted to you first
-quoiromantic: you don't know if you experience romantic attraction, you don't understand romantic attraction or you can't tell romantic and other kinds of attraction apart
-nebularomantic: can't tell romantic and other kinds of attraction apart because of neurodivergency
-aroflux: your romantic attraction fluctuates, either between aro-spec orientations or aro and allo orientations
-caedromantic: you were alloromantic at one point but feel that's been cut away due to past trauma
-bellusromantic: wanting typically romantic things, but not the attraction or the relationship

All of these have sexual counterparts too, just swap out romantic for sexual and there you go

I have reach a point in my own journey of self discovery where I don‚Äôt actually know whether I have romantic feelings or now. Lust I have and I have had relationships in the past, but looking back at them I do not know if what I felt was genuine attachment or a desire to maintain this concept that I believed I needed and which would supply me with the biological functions I enjoyed. 

As an autistic man I am also very prone to hyper fixation. That which interests me; be it a bring, object or concept; can consume my entire focus to the point of obsession. It troubles me often and the more I think on the feeling I once called love the more I wonder if my strange mind was not just fixating on another toy for my mind and body to obsess over.   

Outside of these former relationships I have no desire for companionship, be friendship or otherwise. Closeness to others is just something happens and it is often distracting to my real goals. I know love as I love my family. The birth of my younger sister when I was already a teenager was the first time I realised that there was a being in this world I would die to protect. If romantic love is anything like this then I have not felt it. And all I had before were being I wanted to make feel things that I wished to feel through them. If that last part makes me sound like a monster then good because it‚Äôs a disturbing quality to have. However, feel safe in the knowledge that my intent in this was always positive. Imagine have a lover who can only enjoy sex if you are enjoying it, basically that but more.

"145","text98201",3,0.994592903279403,"I had a similar dilemma in high school where I craved a romantic relationship like it was everything I ever needed but I was TERRIFIED of sex. Any mention of sex in a television show or book I had to skip through. Didn't like discussing any of that with friends or even my parents. I didn't want it, and I honestly didn't feel like I needed it. Finally came to terms with it in college that I was likely asexual. I used the term gray-ace because as far as I was concerned I did want to eventually have kids and there's only one way to do that. So when I got into my first real relationship I was very open about the fact that I might not ever feel intimate attraction towards him. Emotionally I loved him so much but I wasn't ""intimately"" drawn to him in that way. He was very accepting of that and we've been happily married for a bit now--and, to my surprise, I DO feel intimate attraction towards him now and we're expecting our first child in May.

I love how you touched on this and how even aromantic and asexuality is a spectrum in itself. So to anyone experiencing anything similar, you got this! Just be true to yourself and do what you can to keep yourself happy and content. It's unfortunate that society pushes all of us into this box of ""being in a relationship means you're happy now"" but being single and not looking for a relationship is okay too! My story might not be the same as yours but we're all in it together ^^"
"146","text99957",3,0.993636660374553,"As an AroAce myself, you hit the ball out of the park with this video. It really resonated with a lot of my own experience.

I will note however, there are other types of attraction than just romantic and sexual. Most notably, when you were describing your lack of sexual attraction, the example you gave, of being able to identify someone as being ""conventionally attractive"", but not actually finding their appearance appealing to you, actually seemed a lot like it might have been a lack of aesthetic attraction, as well as sexual attraction. For example, I find many people visually appealing, to the point that I enjoy looking at them and being around them because of it, but that's completely separate from wanting to actually date them or do anything else with them.

I just thought this was worth mentioning, because the presence of aesthetic attraction can sometimes make it a lot harder to realize you are asexual, especially when a lot of the ways people get exposed to the idea of asexuality (like this video) often unintentionally conflate the two.

The topic of Asexuality and all it's subcategories is incredibly complicated, and I don't blame anyone for making minor errors like this. It's basically unavoidable."
"147","text101234",3,0.994056994018386,"Honestly what's great about this is it is also a highlight of romantic/'intimate' difference. I'm Heteromantic bi/pan sexual (i still don't fully grasp the subtle differences between bi/pan so i can't suss out which of the two i am yet.) And for awhile i thought something was off cause, guys hot, but also, not really interested in dating guys. It wasn't untill the more active separation of romance from sex (Due to my general understanding is that sex is usually tied to romance) that i began to really understand myself. 

Similarly even though i am heteromantic, i agree with jaiden, you don't need a relationship to  be happy, infact, i often think that the pushing by society to be in a relationship is the very reason divorce is so high. People jump into relationships for all the wrong reasons. You have to be comfortable with yourself, by yourself to a decent enough degree, in my honest opinion, before you are healthy enough emotionally and mentally to be in a relationship."
"148","text102787",3,0.996422385685324,"Honestly watching this video made me consider a lot about myself because literally everything you described is something I had to deal with at one point in my life.
    Now I should clarify I'm not ace at least I don't think so, I'm actually pansexual and also have Asperger's syndrome which I came kind of to a realization I think most people who are Ace or something of that effect usually have Asperger's syndrome because every single person I've met that is Ace or pans usually has autism.
It might just be correlation but I just found it really weird that like every single person I've met that had Asperger's like me had the same situation.
    We were all incredibly logical since we all kind of struggled with emotions, I actually had a group of friends all of us aspies, we all kind of had this realization where none of us were really interested in relationships.
Not that a lot of us weren't okay with the idea or didn't have romantic feelings it's just that it was this weird thing where we all kind of collectively and logically realize that there was just no point in having one and because our emotions are already a little off due to our condition that there was really no need or desire to pursue one.
      
 This video hits though just pretty much way too close to home because at a real point in my life I had to come to the realization that ""OH yeah I'm different than everybody else""
I don't process emotions the same way others do and some things I just don't understand it makes no logical sense and that often includes relationships so yeah honestly I appreciate this.

It's so hard to try and get across that I'm just not interested I just have no desire to pursue one, I work in the oil industry so I constantly get messed with over the fact I'm still a virgin and that's just because I really don't care.
Of course not that I don't experience romantic or sexual feelings it's just that they're not as important to me.
     Pretty much I've come to this sort of realization that I will probably never be in a relationship or pursue one but could possibly enter one"
"149","text105556",3,0.995042863250051,"Relationships can take a lot of work, but THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO! 

I used to confuse being attracted to other people while in a relationship (I'm polygamous, pan romantic, ace) and not going through hardships with the relationship as signs of my no longer being interested. This was not true! 

This line of thinking kept me in abusive relationships so much longer than I ever should have even put up with in the first place. If you're reading this, and have been told ""relationships take work"" look up what constitutes as abuse. There are MANY forms, and none but sexual are tought in sex ed, at least not here in Canada. It also ties into consent too. Protect yourself from harm. If you can recognize abuse, it is so much easier to avoid. There are many different kinds too, such as:

- physical abuse (the big, most obvious one)
- mental abuse (finally coming into the limelight)
- emotional abuse (NOT the same as mental, but similar.
- financial abuse
- sexual abuse (this one isn't as cut and dry as it seems. If you are with your partner and you are just too tired, but your significant other wants the sexytime and they pester and pester you, depriving you of sleep... that is sexual abuse. 
Im sure I'm missing some too, but I hope.this helps someone! ‚ô°"
"150","text111107",3,0.994424893779331,"People slapping labels like this while here i am saying my sexuality is alcoholic

I don't really see the need to slap such things. But i guess it is different when absolutely zero emotions are involved. I grew up without much confidence and a ton of trust issues. I rarely ever did try to open up to someone and whenever i did i just spiraled into some kind of crisis

Thing is i'm a very social guy but also a bit of a shut in who doesn't trust. I sometimes fight my fears and self doubt only to be proved wrong when people abandon me. Thing is i guess i am the problem too. Also focused on the negative when i shouldn't.

I don't feel the need to be in a relationship. Well it was once. Didn't go well. She was with someone else and well i'm an alcoholic. Joke. I don't know. 

I forgot my point.

I guess i came here judging too much. I grew up as someone who despite lacking confidence had to build it so i never felt the need to comply. Perhaps it's cause deep down inside i looked down on the people who pushed those norms upon me or i gave up too early.

My point is. I guess you shouldn't try to put it on a pedestal. Label it and all but i don't think it's right for you to make it a thing because it might warp certain expectations. All up to you. I am way more cynical person"

"154","text20832",4,0.9856338017,"Hog rider
The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.

Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.

The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.

A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.

A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough"

It is a weird thing bc aro and ace is not always included in lgbt sometimes, which felt very...isolating. If we dont belong there, where do we belong? Who can we go to?

So hearing from favorite youtubers, it makes me feel seen and acknowledged if thats...again not weird to say. It was nice for both to be explained and shown. With asexuality, it sometimes is almost as frustrating as with the aro experience you shared briefly.

So uh in conclusion, thank you!"
"159","text43022",4,0.988929043720661,"I know this comment is one of a hundred thousand, but I just really want to thank you for talking about it!!! Like... even within the aroace spectrum; barely ANYONE talks about the aro half of it in my own experience. 

While I'm far from being ace, I am pretty sure I'm somewhere on the Aromantic spectrum and it just felt... extremely validating to hear that someone else within the media I consume, is aro too! So just... thanks for putting this out there as much as you have!!! I've heard that there have been some very mean comments, but I really hope that you have just as many, if not more, positive ones backing you up!

Good luck finding your way down the very difficult path that IS asexuality and aromanticism!!!"
"160","text43229",4,0.985315313252084,"While I'm not aroace myself, it always makes me happy to see people with reach talk about their experience with it. I've had times in the past where I wondered if I might be aro, ace, or demi and hearing stories like these had helped me figure myself out. Not to mention I have a number of ace friends who I know are always joyed to see people talking about this and validating it.

I'm glad you could be comfortable enough to share this with people, Jaiden. Even if it felt scary at the time, I think you've helped people by doing it. :)"
"161","text46212",4,0.986916394640679,"so proud of you for being comfortable enough to share this with us!!! your experience practically aligned perfectly with mine when I found out I was also aroace about a year or so ago and its so validating to see someone I admire so much tell the tale and bring to light what being aroace means and explain it in such a simple, yet lovely way! your storytelling style and visuals were prefect for this and tysm for making this video!! always a huge fan of your work, keep it up!! <3"
"162","text47414",4,0.989577032256691,"AAAAHHHH as an acearo myself I got so excited when you said you were acearo! I'm so excited that this is going to reach such a big audience!! It's so lovely that you're putting more awareness out there, thank you so much for sharing your story. I literally cried multiple times during this video as you spoke about your experiences, as I had very similar ones. Also, I'm just so happy that you explained aromanticism and sexuality so simply and clearly, especially aromanticism as no one ever talks about it lo. Again thank you so much for making this video! I can't express how excited I am that the terms ace and aro  are finally becoming more well-known!!"
"163","text49534",4,0.986421124459643,"As a fellow ace I‚Äôm so glad you made this video!!!  This might be weird and sycophantic but I literally JUMPED UP AND DOWN AND SQUEALED when you said it at the beginning.  It‚Äôs awesome to see other people like me online, especially creators I already follow and love.  

Totally understand wanting to remain private!  Also, totally relate to feeling kind of disconnected from the rest of the not-straight community.  Great job explaining everything, and congrats on figuring it out for yourself!"
"164","text58398",4,0.986432114164138,"Woot, more AroAce rep!!! I'm so happy you figured this out about yourself, and was comfortable enough sharing it with us. I think you did a really good job giving a primer on what Aro and Ace identities are, and especially did an excellent job by making it clear that they are two separate (if at times intersecting) identities. I want you to know how meaningful it is to see creators on here sharing and educating about identities we share with them. Thank you, and so much respect to you."

It‚Äôs really interesting and really cool to hear stories coming from someone who identifies as aroace, definitely opens up a new world for so many people. People are gonna watch this and feel validated and understood because you shared something like this which I know was probably difficult but I‚Äôm so happy you did. Everyone and myself are really proud of you <3"

I personally am not ace and or aro, but I know a few people who are and I know they‚Äôd appreciate any representation that they can get and I think your video was educating and super helpful! Even though it was probably a bit uncomfortable I‚Äôm still super proud and I support you no matter what! Us LGBTQIA+ peoples gotta stick together"
"169","text63617",4,0.985895948167522,"You did a wonderful job on this video explaining the terms, and it makes me so happy that you wanted to post this to help give others an inside look on AroAce and to potentially help someone else discover something about themselves. I wish I had this growing up and when I found out I was Ace. I was the same as you when I found out- I was happy and excited to see something that FINALLY made sense! But then to immediately feel isolated by everyone else. It's taken me years and years and years to be open about this, so I cannot thank you enough for sharing your experience."
"170","text64627",4,0.985318839147255,"thank you so much for sharing your experiences! i'm sure this video will help a lot of people who are confused or struggling with themselves. representation like this really helps people understand LGBTQ+ people better- it's one thing to hear about concepts like ""aromantic"" or ""asexual"", but it's a whole nother one to realise they're terms that apply to people you know or look up to. seeing real people, especially those with a platform, share themselves in this way is so important, so thank you for being that person :] best of luck with your personal journey!"

As a fellow aroace, I am so happy to know that you're willing to not only share a big part of yourself, but also that your (yes, I mean your) doing so spreads much needed awareness on these little known orientations! My brother (who didn't know I am aroace) also watched your video and learned what aromantic and asexual was and I was able to come out to him! What you did today was a BIG step for the aro/ace/aroace communities and I couldn't be prouder! I will say that if you find you no longer identify as aro and/or ace that that is a-ok! There's no wrong way to be you! Again, thank you so much for sharing!"

   It can be a real crazy thing to go finding stuff out like that about yourself because of how hardwired it is in our lives and in media, and because of that, it's still really frustrating to have to explain my asexuality to people- or at least the very few people that im comfortable telling about it.

And while more people are aware of asexuality, they don't really have a good understanding of what it is a lot of the time. You did such a good job of explaining both in a very brief and concise way. Thank you so much for sharing a bit of your personal journey and spreading awareness for our two often overlooked but valid as heck identities!"

I am hopeful that this video will help so many people, ace or not. ‚ù§Ô∏è

(also on another note, it makes me real happy to see someone with such a large following be very adamant about boundaries with personal information. it seems like so many people care less and less about how much their followers know about them and it kinda wigs me out)"

And you deserve to be present and supported and confirmed in your identity just as much as everyone else in the community.

I know it doesn't always feel that way (particularly with intersectionality of communities & identities and general gatekeeping that exists) but you are who you are.

I love you (platonically) for who you are and I support you for who you are and how you identify."

I think it's important for everyone to understand sexualities that aren't talked about as much, although that this doesn't affect me directly I find it very informative.

I can't think of any other big youtubers who have come out identifying as aro/ace, so this means a lot. But you also captured and explained what it's like to go through life as an aromantic/asexual so well.

I think it's amazing that you felt like you were able to share this part of you with all of us strangers, representation really is so deeply important, especially for underrepresented identities like aroace.

Thank you for making this video! I am really glad that you've found and identity that feels comfortable. 

I have a lot of respect for you establishing boundaries: a lot of people on the internet seem to forget that people have the right to keep information to themselves and that speculating about the personal details of a stranger is disrespectful.

Also I want to add that when I watched your video about flirting years ago, I found your take incredibly relatable. I didn't realize until later that that was because of my demiromanticism."

"192","text103337",4,0.985478153692085,"ok but did u know that The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.

Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent's defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.

The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.

A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.

A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent's deck if they happen to react to him fast enough"

I really hope to see more enthusiastic welcoming of the aro and ace community at the lgbtqia+ table (for anyone who identifies as aro and ace and would like a seat, so to speak) and this made me so happy to see someone bringing a little information and experience into the spotlight for these identities. I'm trans and vaguely relate somewhere on the ace spectrum and this just really made me happy to hear someone sharing their experiences, and to feel a sense of relating to some of those experiences too. Thank you for helping some folks feel less alone and bringing awareness to a public audience."

Like you said the representation is so important because many of us (whether both or either of the two orientations) can be really confused and feel very isolated without knowing why, I know I did. 
This video can really make a difference I think and I'm so grateful ü•∞üíï

As an aspec person, it's really neat to have such a cool video like this one that briefly explains what it typically means to be aero/ace. It's very nice and it makes me feel less alone and weird.

All in all, best wishes and vibes to you, Jaiden! Good on you for being yourself! You rock!"
