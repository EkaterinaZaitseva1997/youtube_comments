"1","text104263","Oooh! Are we sharing our manufactured crush stories? I have 2 that are somewhat noteworthy!
First one was in elementary school. Everyone was always talking about the boys they thought were cute and their crushes and whatnot. Baby me thought boys were very ugly and annoying (although I never subscribed to cooties, lol) buuut all the girls kept harassing me and saying that I HAD to like someone. I chose this one kid who every other girl seemed to like, cause he apparently liked me? And a couple other girls, too, but yknow. Anyway long story short I bullied the FUCK out of that guy and was generally very very insulting because I didn’t figure out how to interact with guys until high school, whoops! (He didn’t mind too much tho and never got mad abt it? It was a game to both of us but in hindsight it was very mean of me lmao)

Second one isn’t much of a story so much as me constantly getting asked out by my best friend and her girlfriend, saying sure, getting broken up with, and then getting asked out again all throughout middle school. I could not have given less of a shit if I was in a relationship with them or not and it changed nothing about our friendship, I was just sometimes “dating” one or both of them. I also got asked out by several guys, all of whom got a crush on me despite me being very rude to them, and apparently more would have tried if I wasn’t “taken” and also a lesbian.

Turns out I just have a deep distrust and almost hatred for men and am very aesthetically attracted to women. Whoops! At least I’m not unnecessarily mean to guys anymore and am working on trusting them. Character development?"

"7","text39453","I heavily relate to this as someone who struggles a lot with me being aromantic and ace,, it’s definitely really difficult to explain to others but I’m glad there are more people to speak up about it"
"8","text6988","why tf are mfs complaining about this video, she is just talking about her sexuality, you guys gotta learn to respect"

"13","text51703","aaah thank you for sharing this, i know this kind of video would have been really helpful for younger-me!

(i do think we shouldn't use any kind of love to define ""humanity"" tho, lots of people don't feel feelings conventionally but cndjsjhj defining humanity is not the point of this video i know)"
"14","text45783","Thank you so much for making this video and helping people understand asexuality and aromanticism! I decided to check this out cause a lot of aces on reddit were very excited that you are one of us 😂 I'm ace, but biromantic, and I also feel that if I had known asexuality was a thing when I was younger I would have been way less confused. I had crushes on several boys in school, college, since college, but never had any interest in as you put it, being ""intimate."" Which was very confusing and has made dating very challenging!! Even 5 years ago I think very few people in the general public were familiar with asexuality, but I think it's becoming much more known, so thank you for being part of that!! 💜"

"16","text73229","The thirst for finding and conforming to unique and special identity groups to claim to be anything other than the identity group we are all required to hate, or just refusing new age religious identarian nonsense, is very real."
"17","text81846","I came out as ace-aro a year ago, I’ve struggled a little bit with it since the beginning of Highschool (I’m almost 22 now) and everytime I tried opening up about it, I was either made fun of for being a plant or starfish or dismissed and told me not to give up because there is love for everyone. It made me stay hidden away, and made me force a bunch of crushes and relationships that I didn’t really want, I even lost my friendship with my closest friend cause they thought I had feelings for them when I tried expressing that I didn’t, I just hyper focused wanting to be their friend. So seeing this video makes my heart melt knowing I’m not alone and my experiences are somewhat the same. Thank you for sharing Jaiden, this made my day!"

"37","text47363","I discovered I was Aro Ace (and also an introverted son of a biscuit) by realising that I kept getting irritated at all the shipping and harem fanfics I read. This is not the way to achieving a satisfying way to defeat the BBEG by being smart!!!!!!"
"38","text10937","I'm glad that you had the confidence to publish this thank you
from what you said it is very similar to what I've felt since i was little but for some reason i never realized it i guess i just wanted someone to love romantically like that even though i was never able to find someone i was interested in i mean i find girls attractive but i can't seem to imagine being in a relationship with them and it really confuses me"
"39","text15424","My dream is to be like this, don't have to worry about such Futile things like romance"
"40","text5166","you are amazing jaiden. its wonderful to see a video on asexuality that has so many views, im sure you helped lots of people with this!"

"52","text55757","I understand it's probably scary and personal talking about this kind of thing, but I appreciate you openly discussing this sort of thing. (Also I identified as aro for a long time, then didn't, and this is making me think ""maybe I'm still aro and maybe that's okay"")"
"53","text20190","At least I know I'm aromantic"
"54","text53019","Do really people get upset over that kind of stuff. I mean I couldn't care less about my own sexuality and fact that for 17 years I haven't felt any kind of attraction towards anyone does not make me feel bad. Weird...... well I guess I'm moving on."

"62","text92495","Damn osp and jaiden. My favourite animation channels predominately asexual. Have i found the secret formula? … no i have not. but i mean its cool representation is growing i mean jaiden has a massive audience and i think it was cool to do this. I personally identified asexually for a little while (which is a strange thing to say but it would make sense if i explained the story) and most people didnt know what i was talking about. I mean some people even thought it meant i had sex with animals and honestly idek what to say to that. 
So this is nice"
"63","text27615","@6:32 that logic is actually why ace and aro people (before the popularization of their own labels) were historically included in the bi community! It’s a super common thought process"

"65","text111293","I would like to say I guessed you might’ve been on the spectrum from the flirting video but I of course didn’t wanna assume until you said anything"

"74","text6089","I liek that you keep showing video games in comparison because so often I'm just like ""ughh I don't want to have sex I could be playing video games instead u_u""

I was 27 when I discovered the term asexual, and having the vocabulary to describe my experiences is so powerful. I'm glad that you figured out your labels and are being open about it so that hopefully others can learn more so we can make sure others don't feel like they're broken and have no idea why they're different. <3"
"75","text3436","You sound complex but also not."
"76","text68846","Jaden i just feel u overanalyze what romance is ""suppose to be or feel like"" maby youve havd romantic feelings at some point but maby you dont understand exately what that is about. Also i think u can be in love without wanting the fysichql stuff i think kissing holding hands and stuff falls more into asexual territorium or am i wrong? Romance is about feeling stuff maby.

When i fall inlove i idolise people like just as a cool person from a band.

And usually its just as u said u get tunnel vision u wanna be close to then all the time.

Usually u dont feel like that with a friend a friend would cal lthat obsessive i think."
"77","text59706","I wish I was aro ace, I'm just aro."
"78","text114206","Question: so what’s the difference between aerosexual/asexual/aeroace and just not being interested in relationships? Why does it need its own sexuality?
And furthermore, why the need for representation? Sure you dont have to be in a relationship to be happy, but family, religion, and a good job have been proven to be key factors in someone’s long-term happiness."

"91","text103576","1) I recently found out I'm kind of a hybrid social/psychopath (which always sounds bad but I don't think I'm in the negative side) but your journey to to find out why you don't feel how others feel about things I relate greatly and yeah I agree not being bogged down with feelings is very freeing
2) I thought you already knew your were this way before, you have mentioned in other videos you don't feel romantically attracted to people... I'm sorry you hadn't figured it out before it that I didn't catch it, the chances of you reading my messages are statistically low I get that but in the off chance I caught it earlier and you happen upon my message would have saved you so much time and probably stress"
"92","text82015","I am super proud of you Jaiden! I supporttt!"
"93","text74231","I think the s tier orientations are Pan and Aroace"
"94","text28365","Can people in the comment like stop saying that jaiden is gay AND KNOW THE DEFINITION OF ASEXUAL The definition of asexual means a person that's whose not attracted to male or female or other genders that who has a low interest in relationship."
"95","text55697","Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?

Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know? Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night."
