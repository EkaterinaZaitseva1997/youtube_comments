1,"Indeed, all comments include their own experiences - about friends or about own relationships, quite often use a word experience, example, or relate, or the story may begin with 'I realized'. Quite a few comments with the word 'crush' in them, perhaps this word has triggered a wave of memories in people. These are definitely comments from people who support the topic.",Own experience
2,"Definitely spam, comments in a different language, repeated comments with the same content, mostly of the same word.",Spam
3,"Quite a few comments can still contain their personal experiences, but the comments are more in the spirit of a debate. They contrast their opinions on the topic as a whole, sometimes backing it up with real-life examples, and using definitions of some terms. We can even assume that some of these people are not entirely supportive of the topic, so they have started a debate.",Personal opinion
4,"Almost all comments contain words of thankfulness that the video was published, or how happy they are that it came out. Mostly words of support without opinion or experience.",Gratitude
